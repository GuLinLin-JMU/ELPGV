# Brief introduction <br>
Whole genome variants offer sufficient information for genetic prediction of human disease, 
and animal/plant breeding values that has been widely accepted for animal breeding. 
Many sophisticate statistical algorithms have been developed for enhancing the prediction accuracy;
however, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, so far no method can beat anther. 
We herein propose a new ensemble learning strategy, called ELPGV (Ensemble Learning of Prediction for
Genetic Value) for genetic prediction, which assembles predictions from several basic methods, 
to more accurate predictions.
